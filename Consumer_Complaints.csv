I was duped into opening a Fortiva Retail Credit Card account by a Sales Representative in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.Since my minimum payment was reduced in XX/XX/XXXX every time I go to pay my monthly minimum payment to Fortiva my statement is saying a {$110.00} is due. This is not correct my monthly minimum payment is {$63.00} a month.,Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Atlanticus Services Corporation,NY,10462,,Consent provided,Web,19-04-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6854957

As of XX/XX/18, XXXX has no record of me and therefore will not discuss the mortgage with me. Despite WF 's claim that the loan would be transferred exactly as it was, XXXX does not show the COVID forbearance in place and therefore has the loan as 6 months past due. XXXX has also issued payment for taxes that were already paid. WF refuses to provide any information as to what was sent to XXXX, thereby shielding themselves from any claim of failure to exercise proper care in executing the transfer.

I don't see anywhere that states where the account was last verified. I don't see a ( n ) account status on this report either so is it reporting open or closed. Account is showing a balance owed yet I have never receivied a 1099-c from the " original creditor ''.

US Bank is reporting to them every month that I am over the credit limit. It appears to me that US Bank is selectively ( profiling ) minorities by indicating that I am over the limit to all three credit bureaus. They are selecting what to report instead of reporting accurate account information to the bureaus. 

I have never went over the credit limit on this account. I have made numerous attempts to resolve the issue with US Bank by requesting a status update letter. However, the letter does not indicate the credit limit. 

I do believe that they are not practicing in good faith as it relates to addressing concerns of minority Americans. I believe they are targeting minorities by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus every month. 

I called US Bank and asked them would they tell me the day that my credit card was over the limit or even when I owed {$5000.00} on the credit card, both supervisors that I spoke with told me that I was never over the credit limit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,TX,75067,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,10-04-2023,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6821760

12-04-2023,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Denied request to lower payments,"In XXXX of XXXX, Wells Fargo entered into a settlement agreement with the state of Ohio to compensate the state and their victims for their violation of consumer trust. In XXXX, I received a check from Wells Fargo Auto with the memo XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$48.00}. I began contacting Wells Fargo to let them know this amount doesnt compensate me. Nor does it make up for the impact that their illegalities have had on my life. I have only received rude refusals from Wells Fargo to date, and in one XXXX call a representative questioned my Covid status. 

As a victim of Wells Fargo Dealer Services, I was negatively impacted by the lies and deception of Wells Fargo Bank. As an XXXX XXXX citizen and tax-payer, I'm appalled that Wells Fargo Bank was allowed to discriminate against me and so many others for so long. I suffered a devastating loss that I'm yet to recover from, and it cost me dearly. 

I remember how they held my check when I bought my car and the dealer was instructed not to release the vehicle. I remember how they argued with me when I wanted to discuss payment options causing me mental anguish and emotional distress. I remember how my father, a US Veteran of the XXXX XXXX, had to help me financially when Wells Fargo refused to grant me hardship when I lost employment. 

I remember XXXX weekend of XX/XX/XXXX, getting the call that Wells Fargo ordered repossession of my XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The person who called me, told me coldly that I had a small window to get my belongings. I remember subsequently losing my job the next month because I didn't have a car. I remember subsequently being evicted and being homeless for the next few years, surfing from couch to couch relying on my family because I didn't have a car. I remember my small business grinding to a stop, losing countless opportunities. I remember losing my parents trust, and how I had to explain how Wells Fargo acted. I remember my father saying how it seemed shady. 

What I endured as a result of Wells Fargo and their "" gaming '' and what they've done to my trust as not only a consumer but as a citizen, is traumatic. Their actions forced me into bankruptcy. 

In a XXXX phone conversation with XXXX # XXXX, I was gamed when Wells Fargo disregarded my consumer rights. I requested the default terms of my loan and was informed by someone named XXXX that they would be mailed to me. I never received my terms via mail. I also requested extension on my payment date to redeem my car. I was informed by XXXX # XXXX that Wells Fargo is not required by law to contact me regarding their decision to grant me an extension on my account. 

XXXX informed me that I was granted an extension until XX/XX/XXXX. However I was never informed of this decision by Wells Fargo. The car moved to auction and I never received the requested information from Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX - XXXX received my offer of XXXX to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. She informed me that two solutions exist, 1 ) email an offer and wait 2-3 biz days for response or 2 ) speak with collection specialist to receive a decision. I was transferred to XXXX to speak with a collection specialist representative as XXXX reported only specialist could make a decision on my offer. 

XXXX, the collection specialist stated that XXXX gave bad and/or erroneous information. He reported that he had no role in the process. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with representative # XXXX XXXX who informed me that XXXX was unavailable and that she could not confirm the process or provide further information. She only confirmed my offer of XXXX being submitted. 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX I placed a call to Wells Fargo and made an offer of a payment of XXXX to redeem my vehicle. The representative refused to document my offer. I was informed on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX by a representative that I must make payment before XX/XX/XXXXXXXX or else my vehicle would be auctioned. This contradicted a court letter that informed that the car would not be auctioned on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX if the account has not been settled. 

XXXX, a Wells Fargo collections rep, stated that he had no knowledge of redemption process given to me by XXXX. I was transferred to XXXX a Wells Fargo Collection representative who stated that XXXX was his supervisor. He stated that everyone I spoke with provided wrong and/or erroneous information. He stated that he will not supply the terms or policies in writing, citing what he called legal nature of letterhead. '' XXXX stated that he could make no negotiations on behalf of Wells Fargo. 

All of these communications equated to gaming tactics meant to willfully violate my consumer rights. I lost relationships, wages, housing, and opportunities due to to these illegal tactics. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX I was awaiting XXXX XXXX, a specialist with Wells Fargo, to return my call regarding this dispute. That call never came. Subsequent calls were negative, and I was being laughed off of the phone. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Im still seeking adequate compensation and Wells Fargo has even declined to share their arbitration clause. 

I'm seeking adequate compensation from Wells Fargo and have made several unsuccessful attempts contacting Wells Fargo to resolve this matter. I'm seeking assistance from my representatives in contacting Wells Fargo and working toward a resolution. By contacting my US Representative and the US Treasury Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, I want to share how Wells Fargo 's illegal actions and gaming tactics have detrimentally impacted my life. 

I've received check with the memo XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$48.00}. Im demanding an additional {$920000.00} for compensation plus {>= $1,000,000} for future medical expenses.

Under the Fair Debt Collector Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 U.S.C 1692 ( G ) Section 809 ( B ) I disputed a claim and requested a validation of debt For Account # XXXX in the amount of {$70000.00}. They have failed to do so properly even with ample time given. Golden1 Credit Union Had an obligation to respond and properly validate the alleged debt or they admit by silence and agree that I do not owe this debt. Golden1 Credit union has also violated my cease-and-desist letter by continuing to collect a debt in which I believe I do not owe and which they agree by not rebutting any statement I sent. Golden1 Credit Union is also reporting to credit reporting agencies that I owe this debt which is hindering me from getting a loan and getting approved for credit from lenders by claiming fraudulently that I owe such debt. Golden1 Credit Union and I entered into contract on or about the XXXX of XX/XX/2022 for a vehicle. Upon me learning of the fraud inside of the contract I sent them a letter of recission under 15 U.S.C 1635 ( a ) notifying them in accordance with the bureau. Also I informed Golden1 Credit Union that under 15 U.S.C 1605 Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the Finance Charge in connection with any consumer transaction shall be determined as the SUM OF ALL CHARGES, payable directly or indirectly by the person whom credit is extended. Ive pointed out to Golden1 Credit Union being the indentured trustee where that was violated in said contract and contacting me for any reason about a debt or attempting to collect a debt according to 15 U.S.C 1692 ( b ) ( 2 ) which states that you may not state that I a consumer owes any Debt. So not only is Golden1 Credit Union not validating a debt in question but they are violating my cease and desist order and reporting to credit reporting agencies about this debt and I have NEVER given them permission to do so.

15-04-2023,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"This concerns my PayPal Credit Account XXXX Synchrony Bank ). I request each month that a portion of my payment be allocated to retire Promotional, Special Financing Purchases. I usually complete this easily via PayPal Credit 's chat function. This month ( XX/XX/2023 ), I chatted on XX/XX/XXXX with instructions regarding how to apply the payment, as I have done for months. I always review this chat call within 2 days of completion to confirm correct allocation of my payment to the corrrect Promotional Purchases. On XX/XX/XXXX I engaged in a new chat on the PayPal Credit site b/c my payment instructions from the XX/XX/XXXX chat were not followed correctly. In the XX/XX/XXXX chat I pointed out the error and the agent stated it would be corrected pursuant to my instructions. In each chat session, I finish with a recap to confirm the instructions are followed. The agent confirmed understanding of my instructions on XX/XX/XXXX. On or around XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, I confirmed that the payment had been misallocated again. I called PayPal Credit directly at this juncture to correct the errors again. After reviewing my account online on XX/XX/XXXX, I confirmed that the misallocation still existed and further, PayPal Credit actually increased the balance of one of my Promotional Purchases by {$100.00} in its error-filled misallocation of my payment. On XX/XX/XXXX I called again to address the issue. The manager I spoke with stated he could not correct the current allocation ( b/c we had passed into a new billing cycle ) and would put in a request to "" review. '' This situation will now cause me to incur over {$120.00} of deferred and accrued interest on the Promotional Purchase that expires in XX/XX/2023. This is a constant problem with PayPal Credit ( Synchrony Bank ) and is now causing me direct financial harm. Due to antiquated legacy systems, Synchrony is not able to correct my account for XXXX to 60 days, and provided no assurances I would not incur the deferred/accrued interest charges, due directly to their errors. No admission of the errors or misallocation were offered and no apology. I am asserting direct financial harm in the range of hundreds of dollars as a result.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,IN,46544,Older American,Consent provided,Web,15-04-2023,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6845263

15-03-2023,Debt collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,Received multiple phone calls since XXXX from XXXX. When I returned calls someone named XXXX XXXX answered and asked for XXXX XXXX. XXXX is my mother who is deceased since 1993. I was very upset and asked this woman what " personal business matter '' she could possibly have with a woman dead XXXX years? She refused to tell me anything but they called my cell number? My concern is if this is a collection call it must be due to fraud because no one collects debts from XXXX years ago. When I tried to explain this to XXXX XXXX she refused to tell me anything. I want this company investigated because this is likely due to criminal behavior. The company is evidently a debt collection agency which purchases old debts. They should NOT be contacting me or harassing me when my mother is deceased since XXXX. This is predatory and abusive practice if I ever witnessed it. Calling a relative of a deceased person to harass for debt must be a violation of FDCPA.

18-04-2023,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX I went to a US BANK branch to open a brand new checking account. As it's very usual between banks, I found out on their website that there was a first account bonus of {$500.00} that was being offered from US BANK at that time so when I was opening the account at the branch, I told the US BANK branch manager that I would like that bonus applied to my account, so he looked up on his US BANK system and made sure the bonus would get applied, no problems at all. After meeting the requirements to receive the bonus, which at that time was receiving {$6000.00} or more from direct deposits, I called US BANK customer service wondering when I was going to receive the bonus, and that's when things started to get bad. The customer support representative told me that the bonus code applied to my account was from an older promotion that was already expired and that I should contact the branch that opened the account for me, and that's what I did. When contacting the branch, I explained to them the situation and showed them that the bonus code that was applied to my account was already expired at that time ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and that the correct one was another code ( the XXXX available from their website at that time ). This was basically a mistake from the US BANK manager when opening my account. The response I got from them was that they had contacted the department responsible for promotions and basically the promotion that I had found on the US BANK website, open for everyone to see, was a promotion made for specific people only and that if I don't provide proof that I was meant to receive the promotion, I wouldn't be getting the bonus. 

After getting that response I could not feel more deceived. First, I found the bonus on their website open for everyone to see. Second, the manager does not tell me anything about it and says that the bonus would be applied. Third, out of nothing they tell me I wasn't meant to be receiving this bonus. The funniest part is that I told XXXX friends about the US BANK first account bonus and all of them went on XXXX to open their account and guess what? ALL OF THEM received a first account bonus on their account. I don't know what is up with US BANK first account bonus, sometimes they decide it's for everyone and sometimes they decide that it's just for a specific group of people. 

I can't express how disappointed I am, if someone had explicitly told me that bonus wasn't meant for me, I would just have gone to another bank. I was a victim of a false advertising. I was misled into believing that I would get a bonus from opening an account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,CA,96161,,Consent provided,Web,18-04-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6856079

They charged my Credit Card through XXXXXXXX XXXX My furniture was delivered. Several strange transactions happened during the week of XX/XX/XXXX, the company would charge my account and then take the charge off. I was very confused about what was happening. However, since I had my furniture and was very busy with work I moved on. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I was contacted by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. They said that during an audit they made a mistake and I was undercharged. I told them that was between them and my XXXX Credit Card Company. I contacted XXXX and was informed that XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX had 120 days from the date of purchase to report any errors. I am in good standing with XXXX and the rest of my credit. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX sent their problem to a collections agency, Clear Recovery. Clear Recovery sent me a letter demanding the money. I told them no, that XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is responsible for the error and they use this as a learning tool. Clear Recovery requested a screenshot of my Credit Card transactions from XX/XX/XXXX. I told them no way and that if XXXXXXXX XXXX needs a screenshot of my Credit Card on the transactions that were completed on XX/XX/XXXX, they have an accounting problem. I did offer to give them the XXXX reference numbers of the transactions but neither XXXXXXXX XXXX nor Clear Recovery wanted those. I am sure that since the 120 maximum days to report errors to XXXX have expired that this would not matter. 

I do not use XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for credit accounts nor will use them to purchase furniture ever again.

Owner : XXXX XXXX Dear CFPB : I am writing to you because I am trying to seek a loan modification, and I believe that the loan servicer ( Village Capital ), is refusing to follow the guidelines pursuant to HAMP. I am asking the CFPB to please conduct a review of my account to determine if my suspicions are correct. 
I have owned the subject property since XXXX. 

Although Village Capital is my loan servicer, I am unaware of the present lender, which is allegedly a governmental organization. I have tried to obtain a loan modification through their loss mitigation program. I have not been advised of the status of my loan modification/RMA packet aside from a denial based on ( 1 ) lack of documents ; BUT ; ( 2 ) I was informed in writing and telephonically that my application was complete. ) This can not be reconciled.

Therefore, because Village Capital has been the designated loan servicer, I am asking that you look into the following issues : Did the servicer give me a fair opportunity to be evaluated under HAMP ( and all relevant laws ), because my application was denied for lack of documents despite SPS previously acknowledging that my loan modification/RMA packet ( packet ) was complete?

Although there is no pending sale date, is Village Capital intentionally declining to review my subsequent packet?

For what reason ( s ) am I ineligible for co-signer release? And, if I am not truly eligible, can you help me understand the reasons why I would be deemed ineligible?

In order to determine if I am eligibleand because I would like to receive the documents requested per a qualified written request ( QWR ) I had sent to Village Capital. The timeline to provide me documentation per the QWR has passed. Can you assist me in requesting the loan servicer to provide me ALL of the requested documents I am legally entitle to?

At present, there is no sale date on my subject property. From my review of the laws under HAMP, I understand that your office has the authority to investigate these types of matters and I am requesting the CFPB to assist me.

Thank you, and if you have any questions other concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at the address set forth above.

07-04-2023,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,A Law firm received a default judgment against me in XXXX in the state of New Jersey. They received this judgment by sending court documents to my childhood home in which I did not live anymore my ( grandmother 's house ). They were also sending mail to my moms vacant home in NJ in order to get a wage garnishment 17 years later. This attorney was able to get wage garnishments even though there was improper service of all documents. I was not given the chance to respond to any motions that were filed against me. The only way I found out about the garnishments was by emails via XXXX. This attorney also tried to XXXX money out of my bank account on the same day they are getting wages out of my pay. They have caused me great financial hardship as I have expressed to the courts multiple times without receiving any elief. The worse part is that I never had a credit account with the original creditors nor do I have any information regarding these accounts. The original creditors have closed down and I have been unable to contact anyone to ask about these accounts as they are fraudulent. This same company was charged by the SEC for fraud and sued by other consumers multiple times over the last 15 years. I have filed several documents for identity theft and mail fraud in the past which were overlooked. I have been to court 2 times about this and the last hearing was dismissed without prejudice meaning I have another chance to stop this attorney who is trying to ruin my life. This attorney is going after everything I own and is trying to get me to lose my job by obtaining multiple garnishments under the same terms default judgments sent to the wrong addresses 11 to 18 years ago. The second wage garnishment was done in retaliation which is unethical and inhumane. They are attempting to make me lose everything I have in order to support my children and myself over unverified debt they have added XXXX of dollars of attorneys fees in order to increase the amount owed for their own personal gain. I'm in dire need of help in order to save my life.,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Velocity Portfolio Group,GA,30094,,Consent provided,Web,07-04-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6802804

19-04-2023,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Wells Fargo is the servicer of my mortgage, which is owned by XXXX XXXX. I want Wells Fargo to stop servicing my loan and return it to XXXX XXXX for the following reasons, which the CFPB should check into : - Not correctly removing a borrower from forbearance. They were supposed to take me out, but the representative messed up and did not process my acceptance of the modification. This took countless phone calls and time to get them to correct this last year. 

- After the nightmare of them not removing me properly from forbearance, they sent me a letter saying they could begin the foreclosure process anytime, when I was current. I called and no one could tell me why that letter came to me. Isn't it illegal to threaten to foreclose on a home that is current? 

- Currently, Wells Fargo has had my full payment since XX/XX/XXXX. Tomorrow will be a week since they received all the funds. They received the majority of the funds from the North Carolina Home Owners Assistance Fund back in XXXX but did not put it on the account for almost two weeks. I was waiting to make sure they put the funds on the account and then I made the remaining payment on XX/XX/XXXX. To date, I'm showing past due on their site, as I'm passed the "" grace period '' for my payment. Which they have the entire payment ( since XX/XX/XXXX ). I spoke with Wells Fargo to discuss this matter on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Both times, I was assured it would not go passed the grace period. These actions are absolutely unfair and deceptive acts and practices. How can a bank have your entire payment for a week, keep it sitting in "" unapplied funds '' even after the customer has called numerous times?",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,28278,,Consent provided,Web,19-04-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6855246

18-04-2023,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"After the first complaint I filed, was told to bad Wells Fargos records of our account show that no XXXX XXXX payments were made. I have been able to prove they had been made. Not denying it just sorry but its not enough. Ok, Im dealing with and talking about a company that has been sued and fined 20+ times. Now the Cfpb sends all complaints about Wells Fargo to Wells Fargo! Ive been able to prove the XXXX XXXX payments, sorry but again there records prove different, Oh they say they only go back 7 years. So Wells Fargo can only go back 7 years and XXXX XXXX only to XXXX. This all changed when XXXX XXXX saw the bubble burst coming and began insulating themselves from any lawsuits in the future, by claiming they were never aware and if they were they were not willing and knowingly involved with Wells Fargo and XXXX payments through XXXX XXXX. I have said since I filed the original complaint. I know we made the payments and we were not behind. I have said since the beginning, I took my receipts from XXXX XXXX, and I was told that I would have a number wrong or switched. I have those actual wires and on them you can see, the 4 that wasnt wrong, thats what I was being told repeatedly! It started in XXXX when we first bought the house. Its still continuing to this day. I didnt send all the papers for Wells Fargo to inform me that we had been late or not making payments. When Im fact we were and had made our payments. The blatant strealing started basically as soon as we signed the contract with Wells Fargo. As you can see we made payments from our bank account that shows up months after the actual date of payments. We were making our regular house payment and literally bring bombarded with final notification, the mortgage statement sending payments to XXXX MD, XXXX final notice from North Carolina,! the amount of bills and statements. The XXXX XXXX receipts that started in XXXX showing proof of payments to be told I was off a number. I filed complaints with Wells Fargo as early as XXXX, not knowing that XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo were just blatantly stealing everything. In XXXX XXXX. I. One month of payments between XXXX XXXX and bank payments! We payed and payed. I have never changed what I have said regarding Wells Fargo and their out right criminal actions and activities for so long. Now with the help of the Cfpb, Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX, still are robbing consumers. I have proven time and time that all my statements have been true. We are asking for XXXX XXXX dollars now since its the 3rd time filing a complaint to be told that oh well you dont have any proof. This proves no matter how or when or what payment process we made, Wells Fargo has continued to refuse to compensate us for now the 22 + years, never denying what Im claiming, because what I have claimed has been true. So knowing this and knowing we were and had always been making our house payments, on top of the years and years of double triple billing claiming we never made the payments. So we would have never should have been to a loan modification let alone one that raised the principal and extended the payments for another 30 years. The forced bankruptcy, add the health damage to my wife. Knowing she made everyone of the payments only to be told we were past due. In one month XXXX. In XXXX. The mortgage statements are not even right, XXXX shows we never had a loan modification. I want XXXX XXXX for the fact I have proven with our first 3 complaints. Wells Fargo is still allowed to run a criminal enterprise along with XXXX XXXX and the Cfpb. This is why no consumer can get any type of restitution from years and thousands and thousands of dollars stolen. Stolen by our mortgage company and the payment services they insisted we use due to the easiness they together made for us. Now Im retired with limited funds my wife is now disabled, mainly due to the stress of dealing with Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX, which in turn caused a genetic disorder to take over again due to and still the stress of all this. When I should just get a call as to were to wire our money. Wells Fargo claims they can only go back 7 years XXXX XXXX can only go to XXXX. Good thing I have XXXX of just illegal and blatant stealing of every payment made, XXXX XXXX , our bank account, it didnt matter Wells Fargo took them all.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,WV,25303,Older American,Consent provided,Web,18-04-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6853877

When I inquired about the missing documents I was told to wait because of course the County of XXXX XXXX was backed logged. I wanted a complete year. I notice that only the taxes on my primary home was paid in XXXX of XXXX, so I inquired about the second home not being paid. They ignored my concerns so I paid the complete bill myself. It is only then that they tried to come behind and pay the same bill ; however, my payment cleared first. The credit union has yet to give me back the refund the county sent back to them in XX/XX/XXXX. I then went into the back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to the same Manager, XXXX XXXX, whom helped me earlier in XX/XX/XXXX. She informed my that they would put the money into my checking account in 5 days. Instead the institution took an other withdrawal from my escrow account and sent it to the County. Schools First was given proof that XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX taxes had been paid in full by in XX/XX/XXXX by me. 

Their mishandling of paperwork and my funding has caused emotional and financial hardship. It is giving me XXXX and I can not catch a break with my bills and spending because they have not refunded me the money. It seems that their institution is penalizing because I inquired about the missing documents at the end of the refinance. They have been dismissive and seemingly punitive toward me and my accounts ever since. I feel harassed and financially victimized.",Company believes the complaint provided an opportunity to answer consumer's questions,SCHOOLSFIRST FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,CA,90807,,Consent provided,Web,12-04-2023,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6829405

As I have been researching my legal options in regards to my debt, I have come across a legislative act that may provide me with the means to discharge my debt entirely. The act is known as HJR 192.

HJR 192 is a joint resolution that was passed by the U.S. Congress on XXXX XXXX XXXX. This resolution was put in place as a response to the economic turmoil of the Great Depression and sought to address issues of debt and inflation. The resolution was intended to provide a way for individuals to discharge their debts without using traditional forms of currency, such as gold or silver. 
Under HJR 192, all obligations, including debts, were to be discharged by the government. This meant that individuals were no longer required to pay their debts with traditional forms of currency. Instead, the government would provide a way for debts to be discharged using a new form of currency known as "" United States notes. '' Although HJR 192 was ultimately repealed in XXXX, its provisions remain relevant to this day. Many people have successfully used HJR 192 to discharge their debts, including credit card debt. By doing so, they were able to free themselves from the burden of debt and start anew. 

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

13-04-2023,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"Hello, I am writing to dispute several violations of federal laws committed by the creditor regarding my credit report. I am extremely frustrated and emotionally distressed due to the negative impact these violations have had on my life. 

My correct name is XXXX XXXX but bureaus are reporting it as a XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, R. Also my current address is XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, Arkansas XXXX, But bureau reported that I have many addresses like XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, AR XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AR XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AR XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AR XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AR XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX AR XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AR XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX AR XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, AR XXXX. And My wrong Employers is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 


The creditor has reported inaccurate information on my credit report, including multiple addresses that I have never lived at. These inaccuracies have affected my credit score, and have made it difficult for me to obtain credit and loans at reasonable rates. The creditor has violated several federal laws including : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) - This section requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information in a consumer 's credit report. The inaccurate reporting of multiple addresses may be a violation of this section.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1692e - This section prohibits debt collectors from using false, deceptive, or misleading representations in the collection of a debt. Reporting inaccurate addresses may be a violation of this section if the debt collector knew or should have known that the information was false or misleading.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) - 15 U.S.C. 6821 - This section requires businesses to implement reasonable policies and procedures to protect sensitive consumer information from unauthorized access or disclosure. The failure to protect sensitive consumer information resulting in inaccurate reporting of multiple addresses may be a violation of this section.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. - This law requires lenders to provide borrowers with certain disclosures about credit terms and costs. While the reporting of multiple addresses is not a direct violation of TILA, it may be a violation if the incorrect reporting is tied to an inaccurate disclosure of credit terms or costs.

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) - 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. - This law requires mortgage lenders to provide certain disclosures to borrowers and prohibits certain practices, such as kickbacks for referrals. Reporting incorrect addresses could be a violation of RESPA if it is tied to a failure to provide required disclosures or if it is tied to a kickback scheme.

Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq. - This law prohibits lenders from discriminating against borrowers on the basis of certain protected characteristics, such as race, gender, or age. Reporting incorrect addresses could be a violation of ECOA if it results in a lender using inaccurate information to make a discriminatory decision.

Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1666 et seq. - This law requires credit card issuers to provide certain billing error resolution procedures to cardholders. While the reporting of multiple addresses is not a direct violation of the FCBA, it could be a violation if it is tied to a failure to properly handle a billing error dispute. 
These violations have caused me significant financial harm and emotional distress. I have been denied credit and loans, and have been forced to pay higher interest rates due to the inaccurate reporting. It has also caused me significant stress and anxiety, as I feel like my financial security and future opportunities have been compromised. 

I request that you enforce the legal provisions that have been violated, and that the creditor be required to remove the unverified accounts from my credit report. I also request that the creditor be held accountable for the financial and emotional harm they have caused me. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

13-04-2023,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"Hello, I am writing to dispute several violations of federal laws committed by the creditor regarding my credit report. I am extremely frustrated and emotionally distressed due to the negative impact these violations have had on my life. 

My correct name is XXXX XXXX but bureaus are reporting it as a XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX LAST XXXX XXXX XXXX. Also my current address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, South Carolina XXXX, But bureau reported that I have many addresses like XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX SC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX SC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX SC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX. 

The creditor has reported inaccurate information on my credit report, including multiple addresses that I have never lived at. These inaccuracies have affected my credit score, and have made it difficult for me to obtain credit and loans at reasonable rates. The creditor has violated several federal laws including : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) - This section requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information in a consumer 's credit report. The inaccurate reporting of multiple addresses may be a violation of this section.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1692e - This section prohibits debt collectors from using false, deceptive, or misleading representations in the collection of a debt. Reporting inaccurate addresses may be a violation of this section if the debt collector knew or should have known that the information was false or misleading.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) - 15 U.S.C. 6821 - This section requires businesses to implement reasonable policies and procedures to protect sensitive consumer information from unauthorized access or disclosure. The failure to protect sensitive consumer information resulting in inaccurate reporting of multiple addresses may be a violation of this section.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. - This law requires lenders to provide borrowers with certain disclosures about credit terms and costs. While the reporting of multiple addresses is not a direct violation of TILA, it may be a violation if the incorrect reporting is tied to an inaccurate disclosure of credit terms or costs.

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) - 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. - This law requires mortgage lenders to provide certain disclosures to borrowers and prohibits certain practices, such as kickbacks for referrals. Reporting incorrect addresses could be a violation of RESPA if it is tied to a failure to provide required disclosures or if it is tied to a kickback scheme.

Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq. - This law prohibits lenders from discriminating against borrowers on the basis of certain protected characteristics, such as race, gender, or age. Reporting incorrect addresses could be a violation of ECOA if it results in a lender using inaccurate information to make a discriminatory decision.

Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1666 et seq. - This law requires credit card issuers to provide certain billing error resolution procedures to cardholders. While the reporting of multiple addresses is not a direct violation of the FCBA, it could be a violation if it is tied to a failure to properly handle a billing error dispute.

These violations have caused me significant financial harm and emotional distress. I have been denied credit and loans, and have been forced to pay higher interest rates due to the inaccurate reporting. It has also caused me significant stress and anxiety, as I feel like my financial security and future opportunities have been compromised.

I request that you enforce the legal provisions that have been violated, and that the creditor be required to remove the unverified accounts from my credit report. I also request that the creditor be held accountable for the financial and emotional harm they have caused me. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

06-04-2023,Vehicle loan or lease,Lease,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with the interest rate,Hello I leased a used car through XXXX XXXX XXXX sales XXXX Tn. I purchased this with a credit lender Credit Acceptance back in XXXX. This loan was supposed to only be a {$8000.00} loan which the total of the car was {$6900.00} with the Lender giving the funds would equal an extra {$2000.00}. The loan now totals a {$18000.00} loan which I feel I have WELL over paid for this car which is a XXXX XXXX XXXX the remaining balance is {$6000.00}. The day that I purchased the car the car lot initially told me I would only need {$2000.00} down but I did end up giving a little more so that I could have a lower monthly payment. Which is actually far from the truth because the money is going towards interest and not the actual amount I owe. I have been paying this car off for almost XXXX years and when I went to pay off the remaining balance that my interest rate was 22.3 % which was never agreed on! I dont know how a {$7000.00} car is worth {$18000.00}! The lending company refuses to allow me to pay off the remaining balance. I have tried reaching out to multiple managers to settle my debt with them. Each month they are adding extra fees when I have well OVER PAID this car off. The car lot has now since went bankrupt and I have no way of refinancing or anything with this company. I am just wanting to settle with the company I have paid what the car is worth plus some. If there is anyone able to help me settle this dispute or if there is any refinance options please.,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,CREDIT ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION,TN,37918,,Consent provided,Web,06-04-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6803420

06-04-2023,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"I have had multiple problems with Citibank. To include : They routinely locked my account and wouldn't verify that I was me. I had to go in person and sit with the banker ( showed ID and did all account processes ) and they contacted the bankers by phone to lift the hold on my account for verification. Then they would randomly re-lock it and I couldn't verify my identity. On the days it would let me XXXX to another account, it worked. Most days it wouldn't allow me to do it or take out the funds. I would have to go in person to the bank and verify my identity to get cash out instead. I did find that one issue was they mixed up answers to my verification process and I could never get them right because their answers were wrong and they refused to correct it. 

In XXXX I had them cancel my wire transfer, which was done in person with a banker, because of fraud and went through the same process of verifying myself and they almost didn't want to release the funds to a verified account. It took several hours. 

They should not be allowed to withhold funds and transfers because you can't verify yourself, based on their own system swapping questions to answers. At one point I realized this issue because they asked me a verification question I was never given as an option to answer at sign up or at any other point during my banking time. It seems more like they are trying to keep funds wrongfully. 

Additionally their online XXXX transfers would "" error '' when I could verify myself. The in person bank said it was usual and to just try it on a different day. 

This was a repeated problem- they wouldn't allow me to access my funds. 

When I closed my account in XXXX of this year I was still do a tax document for interest on the account. To date they haven't sent it or uploaded it online. I've repeated contacted them via phone and via their online chat. On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed for the first time that I could no longer use the chat feature as they didn't have access to my account. Mind you, I used this feature repeatedly trying to find out where my tax document was. I was told it would be online, I was told it would be mailed. I was told it wasn't due until the end of XXXX. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX I was told that they couldn't help me with the chat feature and I had to call. When I called they told me they already mailed it at the end of XXXX ( to date no receipt ). I asked why they would tell me on the chat it would be published online or not given until the end of XXXX. They didn't have a good answer. Then the person on the telephone said they would have to get permission to give me any tax documents. After a hold I was told permission was granted for me to have the tax documents. They were due to me months ago and once again I am getting the run-around from Citi.

I had been served with a partition summons and in order for me to retain ownership of the subject property and avoid the untenable housing market in XXXX XXXX, I would need to assume the loan away from the co-borrower. The first representative I spoke with advised me that there are only 4 viable reasons for requesting an assumption : divorce, death, deportation and incarceration. When I explained to the representative that the partition demand operates under the same capacity as a divorce decree, she still stuck to what she called the guidelines. I requested to speak with a supervisor and unluckily spoke with XXXX. I asked her the same thing and she repeated exactly what the same representative had told me. She also told me that a loan assumption can not be done by a co-borrower, which is incorrect and untrue. The company is engaging in the very definition of disparate treatment if only certain legal actions allow for an assumption and others do not.

08-04-2023,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have pursued Citibank , N.A . Citi to fulfill the terms of their tiered Personal Checking bonus promotion ( please see attached file titled Citibank Member Cash Checking Offer Enrollment... ) and credit my account with the promised {$400.00}. Below, you will find a detailed timeline of my experience along with my commentary where appropriate. My complaint is supported by numerous documents attached for your review. Thank you. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I applied and opened a checking account online. 
XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a check for over {$15000.00} to satisfy requirements for the {$400.00} tier bonus promotion. 
XX/XX/XXXX I met the requirements for the {$400.00} bonus promotion by maintaining a balance above {$15000.00} for 60 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX - According to the terms of the promotion, the bonus should have been received at the latest by this date. Terms : The cash bonus will be deposited to your open, eligible account within 90 calendar days after you complete all required activities. 
XX/XX/XXXX I chatted with a Citi representative who opened CASE ID : XXXX. The representative wrote : "" The investigation may take up to 5 business days. Responses will be sent after case completion. Your request is being passed for further research regarding your dispute ( XXXX credit total amount exceeds {$250.00} limit ). '' XX/XX/XXXX I called Citi customer service at XXXX. Provided Dispute Reference # XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX for an update. The representative said that the investigation is still in process and could not say how long it would take. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX. I was asked to wait another week and to call back if I do not hear anything. 
XX/XX/XXXX Citi both physically mailed and via secured message within online banking submitted a letter titled Our Research Results with Reference ID : XXXX. ( see Citibank Our Research Results Letter XXXX ) It states : Unfortunately, Promotion Code XXXX was not offered in conjunction with the above account. While Citi does offer cash promotions at times, those offers are only available to theindividual to whom the offer was addressed. 
Please provide a copy of the Promotion Disclosure that was addressed to you. We do not accept a print out of an on-line offer or blog. Please note, if you are unable to provide a copy of the Promotion Disclosure that was addressed you then Citibank will consider this dispute to be resolved. 
If you have any questions or would like to speak with a representative, Customer Service can be contacted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Received another secure message stating Your inquiry, XXXX has been resolved. Before I even had the opportunity to respond to the letters request, within less than 24 hours of receiving the letter, the XX/XX/XXXX letter was DELETED and replaced with a secure message that Your inquiry, XXXX has been resolved ( please see attached files beginning with Citibank Secure Message.. for evidence ). Upon experiencing the deletion of the XX/XX/XXXX letter which prevented me from directly responding with evidence, I filed a CFPB complaint. Complaint ID : XXXX ( please see CFPB Complaint Citibank XXXX ). 
XX/XX/XXXX Citi Responded to CFPB complaint with an attached letter, stating "" Our investigations have a resolution timeframe of 5 business days. You will receive a separate communication with a final decision on this matter .... For additional questions or concerns, please contact our Citiphone customer service at XXXX and reference your investigation number XXXX. '' XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and spoke with XXXX. He said the investigation is still ongoing. He escalated the same investigation that was generated from the original CFPB complaint. He said that a letter would be sent to me within a day or two but may take a little longer due to the holidays. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and spoke with another representative. She said that the investigation is still ongoing at the back office and that the officer reviewing my investigation is currently not available. She said, like each of the previous representatives, that it would take 5 business days even though this duration had lapsed repeatedly. She noted that I had called for a follow up. I inquired about speaking directly with the back office and she said that it is not possible. 
XX/XX/XXXX Citi electronically sent me a second letter titled Our Research Results with Reference ID : XXXX ( see Citibank Our Research Results Letter XXXX ) The letter contains the IDENTICAL TEXT as the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, the one previously mentioned in this timeline. However, oddly enough, the promotion code Citi referenced in the second letter is XXXX while the previous letter referenced XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I chatted with Citi representative named XXXX. XXXX wrote "" Thank you for your kind patience As I can check in the investigation process you are not eligible for the bonus Please do not worry you can contact the dedicated team once over the call they might have option to put the account as exception Here is the direct phone number contact our one stop sales unit at XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX. However, the representative I spoke with was unable to access my Dispute or any information regarding the CFPB complaint letter response from Citi. I then called XXXX as usual and spoke with a representative who instructed me to visit a Citi branch with the evidence requested by the XX/XX/XXXX Citi letter. The representative assured me that a banker at the branch would be able to forward the needed documentation. 
XX/XX/XXXX Met with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) at the XXXX XXXX XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX. XXXX was extremely methodical and thorough. Although he was initially unfamiliar with how to deal with my issue, he was ultimately able to access and review the entire history of my case/dispute. He was able to figure out how to upload the documents I provided using the Citi generated barcode that corresponds to my case Dispute Reference ID : XXXX. I provided him with the Citi email I received on XX/XX/XXXX which was addressed to my email ( the same email on file with Citi ). The email specifically confirmed my enrollment in the bonus promotion. XXXX XXXX and I were able to see the 12-page document that he had attached within Citis system for my case/dispute ( please see Citibank XXXX XXXX & XXXX Documents ). 
XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX for an update. I was told that the documents uploaded in branch by XXXX XXXX were attached to a case that is already closed. Turns out, XXXX XXXX was unable to identify this. The representative on the phone initiated a new case. Case ID : XXXX. The representative said it should take XXXX business days. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I called XXXX. The representative was able to locate the new case and said that it takes 10 to 15 business days from the date the new case was initiated. 
XX/XX/XXXX Given the upcoming CFPB deadline ( XX/XX/XXXX ) for my feedback for my original CFPB complaint, I provided CFPB feedback for Citis response to my original CFPB complaint. ( Complaint ID : XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX for an update. The representative was able to confirm that the documents that were provided to a banker in branch are attached to the new case number. The representative also confirmed that she is able to view them. She went ahead and noted the previous Case/dispute reference numbers to the new one and said that she will make a note to the back office that I requested an update. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX. Although 15 business days had passed since the new case was generated, I was asked to call again on XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I called XXXX. The representative acknowledged that this is the second case for this request and stated that it is still under Appeal Review. The representative said that they are waiting for the Special Investigations Unit to make a decision. She said she made notes to accelerate the process. I was recommended to call back in 5 business days. 
XX/XX/XXXX Citi electronically sent me, for a THIRD TIME, a letter titled Our Research Results with Reference ID XXXX ( see attached ). The letter contains the IDENTICAL TEXT as the letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX - previously mentioned in this timeline. The promotion code Citi referenced is the same as the XX/XX/XXXX letter, XXXX. 

Receiving this third letter, the same template letter as the previous two letters, despite having provided documentation in person at a branch, led me to conclude that I was not making any progress with Citi and I was stuck in an endless cycle. The third letter made no mention of the documentation I provided in branch on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Throughout this process, I have experienced inconsistent and contradictory communication, endless delays, no updates without my inquiry and a lack of specific and unified direction from Citi representatives regarding how to have my case resolved. 
The contact number provided in the letters is the same general customer service number I have called numerous times. Citi did not provide me with contact information to a specific department or team that deals with my specific issue. Documentation and secured messages made no effort to provide a clear, direct and easy way to provide the documentation that their investigation team required. One representative on XX/XX/XXXX suggested visiting a branch and assured me that the documentation would reach the correct team. 
Although I was very pleased with XXXX XXXX XXXX, professionalism and thoroughness to assist me during my branch visit, he was unfamiliar with the process and ultimately attached the document to a closed case that was already closed. He did the best he could and I am very appreciative of his efforts. 
I would like to emphasize again that the third letter dated XX/XX/XXXX I received made no acknowledgement of the documentation that I submitted in person at a branch to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX as a response to the identical, template Our Research Results letter with Reference ID : XXXX that I received on XX/XX/XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",FL,33067,,Consent provided,Web,08-04-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6812750

06-04-2023,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I am writing to request assistance with lender placed insurance. Shellpoint mortgage servicing is the servicing agent for our mortgage lender. As of XX/XX/XXXX, they opened an escrow account, without consent or notification and placed hazard insurance on our account. I have insurance for the condo in question without lapses, but Shellpoint was missing the renewal from the HOA. I did not find out until XX/XX/XXXX that I was being charged for insurance I do not control. Now mind you, this is insurance to cover the entire complex not just my condo. Shellpoint had all the contact information for the HOA and did not contact them directly for this information. 
We sent an email to the HOA on XX/XX/XXXX requesting a certificate of Insurance for the complex and by the afternoon had provided Shellpoint with proof of insurance with no laps in coverage for the HOA. Shellpoint left the hazard insurance in place and continued to charge me. I contacted Shellpoint again on XX/XX/XXXX to get an update and they stated the Certificate of Insurance was only for information purposes and did not include the limits. So, the very same day we got a new certificate of insurance and sent it over. To date my account is still being charged and Shellpoint has made no effort to rectify the situation. 
The fact is Shellpoint neglected to contact any of us. They had my address, cell number, email and contact information for the HOA. They have been provided proof of coverage without lapse on several occasions and neglected to refund the charges. A letter dated XX/XX/XXXX states that they are increasing the cost of the lender placed hazard insurance. This is ludicrous, I can not get Shellpoint to credit my account and in my lender contract it clearly states they can not open an escrow account without the borrowers consent.

The below-listed accounts by the Original Creditors, who have reported these accounts within my credit reports, were not opened by me. I also did not give my authorization for anyone else to open these accounts. Someone else of who did these that I did not know. 


Policy states. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy.

( a ) Reinvestigation ( 1 ) Reinvestigation ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. 

It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve the accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 



It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore, inaccurate in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out go my credit files. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Please remove it from my credit report. 


I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be Blocked and Deleted. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA, Section 1681c ( 2 ) Block of information resulting from identity-theft.

1.Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity-theft, not later than four ( 4 ) business days after the date receipt by such agency of 1. Appropriate proof of identity of the consumer ; 2. A copy of an identity theft report 3. The identification of such information by the consumer ; and 4. A statement by the consumer that the information relating to the transaction by the consumer.

I have provided all of the above listed four ( 4 ) items within this package. Therefore, I expect these listed accounts to be deleted and blocked within ( 4 ) business days. This is clearly an identity theft issue. I am also entitled to receive a free copy of my credit report, so I am requesting a free credit report and that all of these accounts, public records items, and inquiries be permanently blocked and deleted.

13-04-2023,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"In a prior complaint cfpb # XXXX related to unpaid/underpaid property taxes and mismanaged escrow, I noted my credit score had fallen due to Wells Fargo reporting a total mortgage amount well above what my principle balance was set as. I was told in the resolution of my complaint Wells Fargo was reporting everything correctly, and I would have to call credit bureaus. The Wells Fargo credit report provided shows the incorrect amount, but I was told I must be wrong or need to contact the credit bureau. 

Wells Fargo shows my principle balance as {$370000.00}. Credit bureaus, both XXXX XXXX and XXXX ( I have not checked XXXX ) show it as XXXX. That is a difference of over {$14000.00}, and caused my credit score to go down, In most cases moving me from good/fair score to poor scores. I am about to move, this score drop directly impacts my ability to borrow at an optimal interest rate. 

Wells Fargo has made my life hellish for months due to the tax issue and not their refusal to correct the loan amount. I am not sure why there is such a large disconnect, but the only way the bureaus would have this amount is from Wells Fargo. I can not just tell the bureaus they are wrong and get this fixed. Wells Fargo needs to fix this. It is the least they can do after months of pain and emotional distress that they shrug off as nothing and then lie to me that they are reporting everything correctly. 

I am including screen shots of 3 separate credit score details I can access on my Wells Fargo, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX accounts through credit monitoring service provided. I am also attaching my most recent mortgage statement.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,DC,20009,,Consent provided,Web,13-04-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6837661

13-04-2023,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"Hello, I am writing to dispute several violations of federal laws committed by the creditor regarding my credit report. I am extremely frustrated and emotionally distressed due to the negative impact these violations have had on my life. 

My correct name is XXXX XXXX but bureaus are reporting it as a XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Also my current address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Virginia XXXX, But bureau reported that I have many addresses like XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX WASHINGTON XXXX DC XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX WASHINGTON XXXX DC XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX WASHINGTON, DC XXXX XXXX 

The creditor has reported inaccurate information on my credit report, including multiple addresses that I have never lived at. These inaccuracies have affected my credit score, and have made it difficult for me to obtain credit and loans at reasonable rates. The creditor has violated several federal laws including : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) - This section requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information in a consumer 's credit report. The inaccurate reporting of multiple addresses may be a violation of this section. 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1692e - This section prohibits debt collectors from using false, deceptive, or misleading representations in the collection of a debt. Reporting inaccurate addresses may be a violation of this section if the debt collector knew or should have known that the information was false or misleading. 
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) - 15 U.S.C. 6821 - This section requires businesses to implement reasonable policies and procedures to protect sensitive consumer information from unauthorized access or disclosure. The failure to protect sensitive consumer information resulting in inaccurate reporting of multiple addresses may be a violation of this section. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. - This law requires lenders to provide borrowers with certain disclosures about credit terms and costs. While the reporting of multiple addresses is not a direct violation of TILA, it may be a violation if the incorrect reporting is tied to an inaccurate disclosure of credit terms or costs. 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) - 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. - This law requires mortgage lenders to provide certain disclosures to borrowers and prohibits certain practices, such as kickbacks for referrals. Reporting incorrect addresses could be a violation of RESPA if it is tied to a failure to provide required disclosures or if it is tied to a kickback scheme. 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq. - This law prohibits lenders from discriminating against borrowers on the basis of certain protected characteristics, such as race, gender, or age. Reporting incorrect addresses could be a violation of ECOA if it results in a lender using inaccurate information to make a discriminatory decision. 
Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1666 et seq. - This law requires credit card issuers to provide certain billing error resolution procedures to cardholders. While the reporting of multiple addresses is not a direct violation of the FCBA, it could be a violation if it is tied to a failure to properly handle a billing error dispute. 
These violations have caused me significant financial harm and emotional distress. I have been denied credit and loans, and have been forced to pay higher interest rates due to the inaccurate reporting. It has also caused me significant stress and anxiety, as I feel like my financial security and future opportunities have been compromised. 

I request that you enforce the legal provisions that have been violated, and that the creditor be required to remove the unverified accounts from my credit report. I also request that the creditor be held accountable for the financial and emotional harm they have caused me. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
